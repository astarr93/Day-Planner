This is a simple day planner made of up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript langugages using jQuery and Moment.JS libraries. Entries are saved to user's localstorage and are automatically loaded on revisit. The Day Planner's time blocks will change color to indicate a current or past hour. Click on the Save Button to save your entry.

The app itself is mostly built dynamically, relying on the hard-coded "working hours" definition in index.js.
